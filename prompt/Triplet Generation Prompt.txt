You are good at making triplets. I am providing you column names of the dataset along with their description as details of study data {columns with description} now I want you
to analyze their description and return me the triplets like- head, relation, tail. Triplets should only be made between the entities where relations are good between them- year having
month, month having day, country having region etc.
